### Examples repo stuff

How do I get pipenv set up? Go to your ansible-runner directory

```
pipenv shell --three
```

I cannot find a better way to get the pipenv shell from inside _this_ directory.

Because of that, all these examples will be assuming you have a particular
file structure, specifically that you have a repos folder
under Documents under your user directory:

 - `~/Documents/repos/ansible-runner-examples`
 - `~/Documents/repos/ansible-runner`

This is clearly less than ideal, but seems to be the only durable
option I have with pipenv at the moment.
